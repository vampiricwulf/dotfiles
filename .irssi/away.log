01:05 #toehoef: :/ ;/>/Deader_Zo?/ 8/) e?/Also, relating to eyes - you'd have to elaborate in order to fit in how things work in Touhou (since it's not Death Note) since human lifespans are constantly recalculated by shinigami who work in administration of lifespan.

01:10 #toehoef: :/ ;/>/AwayaSouw?/ 8/) e?/Can one infer that the eyes of Shinigami are linked to the lifespan records and "recalibrate" themselves everytime an amendment is made?

01:15 #toehoef: :/ ;/>/AwayaSouw?/ 8/) e?/It's no fun looking at someone with no life span. ..Then again, am I working as a shinigami 'cause it's fun?

01:18 #toehoef: :/ ;/>/Deader_Zo?/ 8/) e?/The last one is the only one that really implies "seeing" it & is obviously a specific Death Note reference (I believe she has another reference too) so it's hard to say exactly how cannon it is... But if you want to say that all shinigami can do it, that wouldn't be a problem.

01:55 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g >booshing me for getting on at 5
02:21 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g So Reaper Shinigami don't exist?
02:21 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Is Komachi talking about Kishin?
02:21 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Shes talking about Kishin, isn't she
02:22 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g Kishin is a high-ranking demon thing in the Ministry, probably. not the Soul Eater kind...
02:22 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g And I'm pretty sure Kishin are the demon assassins that PMiSS talks about
02:22 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g Kishin is just one guy, I think.
02:25 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin isn't a single entity
02:25 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin are demons
02:25 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Suiki is the chief Kishin
02:26 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin is a species
02:26 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Suiki is the chief Kishin
02:26 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin are the demon assassins
02:28 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g There are four Kishin chiefs
02:29 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g ...so your OC is a Kishin?
02:29 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g what a weak Kishin
02:35 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g most hermits probably get killed by some Kishin
02:36 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g People die naturally without a shinigami coming for them
02:37 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g And that is done by kishin, not shinigami
02:37 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g I wonder if that means I need to make Akita a kishin, then
02:40 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g so a Kishin doesn't come after them unless they just continue on for a ridiculously long time like Yuuka seems to be
02:41 #toehoef: 8/<g~>/     Choukog8/>g e8/|g Oh wow, this thing looks cool *is finally getting around to finishing the first volume of Sword Art Online* http://puu.sh/LPBn

00:21 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g also, I'm not sure its the best idea to make an OC a kishin since we have next to no info about them in the Touhou-universe
00:23 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Reapers go after normal people and kishin go after extended lifespans
00:30 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Since the human world is brittle and overpopulated, having a kishin go out there and cause havoc would be trouble
00:30 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Let alone a kishin chief
00:30 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g he's just a low-ranking Kishin though, since you made him weak
00:30 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Hes still a shinigami though
00:31 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g Ag, we tossed out the kishin idea already, he'd still be a shinigami.
00:32 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g So instead of having kishin go around the human world bashing everything and raising high pressure water out of manholes
00:32 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Shinigami like Akita scout for immortals
00:32 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Then alert a kishin when they find them
00:32 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g So the kishin can kill them with as little damage as possible
00:32 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g btw, I think the water thing is specific to Sui-Ki, not to kishin or kishin chiefs in general...
00:33 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g also, there isn't any reason why a kishin can't do the scouting
00:33 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g I would see kishin as combat units
00:34 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g Potential problems I see: There's already an office which keeps track lifespan & kishin only go after immortals once every hundred years...
00:37 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g Also, I would agree that kishin are probably limited in how much they can leave hell. If the rest are anything like Sui-ki, then they're not exactly subtle and would have to be kept busy in hell most of the time, rather than causing problems in Gensokyo/world/etc.
00:38 #toehoef: 8/<g%>/    Mokutoug8/>g e8/|g I figure kishin are mostly comprised of oni, since they have ridiculous power
00:38 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin are most likely Oni that work for the Ministry, yeah
00:38 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Kishin can translate to Oni God, afterall
00:39 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g I'm kinda thinking that "Kishin Chiefs" mentioned in WaHH 12 & "Oni Lords" mentioned in PMiSS may be one and the same.
00:41 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g There are three other Kishin Chiefs
00:41 #toehoef: 8/<g >/Zombie_Fairg8/>g e8/|g It mentioned how directly under each Yama are lesser judges & oni lords who each command several shinigami/lesser oni.
01:06 #toehoef: 8/<g >/AwayaSouweng8/>g e8/|g Recreate Akita into a chainsaw-wielding Kishin named RANNNNN-ki y/n?
